## ✨ Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
- **JavaFX-Based UI**: Utilized JavaFX to create a responsive and intuitive user interface, distinguishing ideFx from other Java IDEs by providing a modern and engaging user experience.
- **Core Development Functionalities**: Integrated essential features such as project management, code editing, compiling, and execution within the IDE, mirroring some of the basic functionalities found in Intellij IDEA.
- **Class File Reading Capability**: Unique to ideFx, this feature allows users to read and analyze `.class` files directly within the IDE, offering insights into compiled bytecode and aiding in debugging processes. This addition underscores the IDE's versatility and comprehensive approach to Java development.
